Here is a repository that's holds R code that was used to find people who were snubbed out of being an NBA allstar. Traditionally the best of the best would be all stars but with the fan vote being put in place many stars who perform above average are left out of the all star game. When run, the R code gives you players who were snubbed from being all stars.(Jackson Edit for pull request)
